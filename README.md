# ASL keyboard
This is an attempt to form a "keyboard" with just ASL input

# Dependencies
We just use PIL and tkinter

# How it works (code)
We used two .txt files to store the configurations of the hand.
Tkinter takes care of all the UI (pain).
PIL is used to process images.

# Concept
We found out all possible configurations of the hand generally used in ASL and used it to form an app.
!!!PLEASE CONSIDER USING A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE TO BUILD APPS especially if your new to coding!!!
